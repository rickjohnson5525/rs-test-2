* Added support for code-server 3.4.0+ (Pro # 1984)

### RStudio Server

* **BREAKING:** RStudio when served via `http` erroneously reported its own address as `https` during redirects if the header `X-Forwarded-Proto` was defined by a proxy. That could lead to a confusing proxy setup. That has been fixed, but existing proxy installations with redirect rewite settings matching for `https` may have to be adjusted.
* **BREAKING:** RStudio Workbench's Linux packages have new file names, `rstudio-workbench-*` instead of `rstudio-server-pro-*`. The operating system package name remains `rstudio-server`, so installs and upgrades will work correctly. Scripts which refer to the `.deb` or `.rpm` file names directly will need to be updated.
* **BREAKING:** RStudio Server no longer supports Internet Explorer 11. 
* Added `session-suspend-on-incomplete-statement` option to enable more aggressive session suspension behavior (Pro #1934)
* New `env-vars` configuration file simplifies setting environment variables for the main RStudio server process.
* Refreshed style on sign-in page; sign-in page now has a dark mode that syncs with the operating system's (#9092, #9093)

### Visual Editor

* The commands "Execute Previous Chunks" and "Execute Subsequent Chunks" now work when the cursor is outside a code chunk in the visual editor (#8500)
