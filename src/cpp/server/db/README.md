## Server Database Schemas

This folder contains the database schemas for the RStudio Server database. These schemas are copied to the build output directory, and are applied to the database every time `rserver` is started.

Schema files rely on a file format convention containing the following:
* The date time at which the script was generated in the format YYYYMMDDHHmmssnnnnnnnnn (where nnnnnnnnn is nanoseconds)
* An underscore separating the date time from the friendly name
* A friendly name for what the script does
* A file extension, which can be `.sql`, `.sqlite`, or `.postgresql`. `.sql` files will be run for any database type, but the other two extensions are reserved for only running if the database in use corresponds to that file extension.

### Generating New Schemas

It can be cumbersome to generate the correct schema file names as they include a precise timestamp. For this purpose, simply run the `make-schema.sh` script from this folder, like so:

```
./make-schema AddNewTable sql
```

This will generate a file like `20200226141952248123456_AddNewTable.sql`. To generate schemas files that are database specific, leave off the `sql` part of the command, which will generate a schema file for each supported database type.

You should not generate both a `.sql` and specific database extension types for the same migration. In this case, both migrations would be run, but this is nonsensical. You should either generate one `.sql` migration for the generic case, or one migration for each specific targetted database, not both.

### Dev Schema Updates

In order to run any new schemas, you simply need to restart `rstudio-server` to ensure that any unapplied schemas are applied. Note that there is currently no way to rollback successful schema updates, so you are responsible for backing up your existing data if that is important to you.

### SQL Naming

Within your schema files, make sure to use `snake_case` naming for all table and column names. There are several reasons for preferring this. For more information, see https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/65899.
