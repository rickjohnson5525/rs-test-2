// Strict is **too strict** and may confuse customers. Better not have it unless explicitly requested.

// - Visiting from email links to RStudio, what would **always** require a new sign-in.
// - Visiting links on other sites to RStudio, what would **always** require a new sign-in.
// That's because `SameSite=Strict` requires that even the `referal` header points to the same site.
